# Argo ApplicationSets

[ApplicationSets](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/application-set/) are Argo's way of reducing duplication when you have (nearly) identical applications to install on all of your clusters. This directory contains the definitions for deploying the dependencies that need to be present on all of our GKE clusters.
