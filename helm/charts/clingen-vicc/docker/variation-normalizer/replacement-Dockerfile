# cool-seq-tool initialization involves writing some files and this doesn't
# work sometimes if multiple worker processes are in that step at the same time
# Either need to limit to 1 worker process, or run the init code prior to starting the
# server processes. cool-seq-tool does not re-run the files initialization if already run.
# There seems to be some sort of slow persistent memory growth. Using gunicorn and max-requests may help
